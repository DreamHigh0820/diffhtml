diffHTML is a library that assists with creating user interfaces using
JavaScript. These interfaces can be: applications, games, data visualizations,
or anything else that you may want to render in a web browser.

This repository is a mono-repo structured with the [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/)
CLI tool. This makes it easier to support continuous integration, consistent
versioning, and working on the various diffHTML tools.
