# <Â±/> diffHTML React Compat 

Stable Version: 1.0.0-beta.4

This is a compatibility package meant to be a drop-in replacement for the
modules: `react` and `react-dom`. It wraps the [diffHTML
Components](../diffhtml-components) repository as the base for the `Component`
constructor. It then layers additional React-specific APIs.

##### Installation

``` sh
npm install diffhtml diffhtml-react-compat
```
